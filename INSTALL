# default instructions
# -----------------------------------
./prepare # if cloned from git
./configure --prefix=/desired/installation/path

make install
make check # optional

# if you want to enable CRUSH support
#-------------------------------------
# NOTE: the following instructions assume that you have compiled Ceph in
# a separate subdirectory from the Ceph source code called "build".  If that
# is not the case then just remove the "build/" prefix from files described
# below.
#
# compile and install CEPH to $CEPH_PREFIX
#   copy src/crush/{crush|builder|mapper|hash}.h to $CEPH_PREFIX/include
#   copy build/src/acconfig.h to $CEPH_PREFIX/include
#   make directory $CEPH_PREFIX/include/include
#   copy src/include/int_types.h to $CEPH_PREFIX/include/include
# follow above default instructions, except add --with-crush=$CEPH_PREFIX
